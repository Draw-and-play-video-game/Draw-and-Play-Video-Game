Sprint goal:  
For this sprint we want to get all of the members access to either a Mac device or some sort of Mac virtual machine. Once that has been accomplished we want
to familiarize everyone with Swift and get the shell of an app created that will take a picture and do basic image processing to it.
            
            
Product log: 
- Get either Mac or Mac virtual machine
- Start using Xcode to use Swift and learn the basics of coding for an app

Scrum record:
  Meeting 1:
  We are waiting to hear back from accounting for licences for Macincloud so that we will have the software to start coding. In the meantime, we are looking up coding tutorials
  for swift and sharing the links with eachother so that once we do have the software we can start coding right away.
