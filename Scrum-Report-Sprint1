Sprint goal:  
For this sprint we want to get all of the members access to either a Mac device or some sort of Mac virtual machine. Once that has been accomplished we want
to familiarize everyone with Swift and get the shell of an app created that will take a picture and do basic image processing to it.
            
            
Product log: 
- Get either Mac or Mac virtual machine
- Start using Xcode to use Swift and learn the basics of coding for an app
- Create the shell of the 'Draw and Play Video Game' app by letting the user take a picture of their drawing and show it on the screen

Scrum record:
  Meeting 1:
  We are waiting to hear back from accounting for licences for Macincloud so that we will have the software to start coding. In the meantime, we are looking up coding tutorials
  for swift and sharing the links with eachother so that once we do have the software we can start coding right away.
  
  Meeting 2:
  We have now all gotten the software to access macincloud (the virtual virtual space) and have started the coding for taking a picture through the app. The problem we are 
  running into now is that the macincloud managed server that we have doesn't allow the user to connect their phone to test the app. We have been talking with Scott to look 
  for an alternative.
  
  Meeting 3:
  We have got conformation from Scott about how we can continue to develop using the managed servers. We will upload our code as beta to the app store and from there we can
  test our beta using an app called Test Flight. We also split up our jobs over the next week between each member. Vinh will be looking into image processing on a pre-uploaded
  image for now. He will start to develop a way to transform that still image into obstacles for the level. Ying will now be looking into the physics engine for the ball. He
  will determine things like direction and velocity. Kyle will be creating the shell/ look of the app to initially take the picture. He will write code to let the user take a
  picture and then use that picture for the images that Vinh is working on processing. Matthew will be looking into Test Flight and seeing how that will work for our project.
  He will be working with Kyle to get the testing of picture taking working using Test Flight.
